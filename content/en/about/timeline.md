Volunteering in the fire service plays a big role in my life. It is important to me to give something back to society and so I take on a wide variety of tasks in the fire brigade: part of the emergency service is also managing the IT of my volunteer fire brigade in Eppendorf. I'm responsible for the technical administration of the homepage [ff-eppendorf.de](https://ff-eppendorf.de), social media and e-mail addresses.
